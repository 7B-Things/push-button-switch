Filament:
    Name: Filament
    Description: >
        Other filament types may work, but PLA and PETG have been tested
        for this switch. PETG should yield better durability, but is not
        required. The diameter should not matter either, but all switch
        prototypes have been printed with 1.75mm diameter filament. The
        color of the filament does not matter.
    Specs:
        Type: PLA or PETG
        Diameter: 1.75mm

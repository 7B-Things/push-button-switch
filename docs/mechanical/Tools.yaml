3DPrinter:
    Name: 3D Printer
    Description: >
        Any FDM 3D printer should work, provided that it has a large
        enough build volume to print the switch cap, which is the 
        largest part. Some 3D printers are listed in the Suppliers
        section for reference only. No specific 3D printer is required
        to complete this build.

Tweezers:
    Name: Tweezers
    Description: >
        Any tweezers with a tip that is small enough to grab thin
        strands of plastic should work fine. For the prototypes sharp
        tweezers that are used to place tiny components on circuit boards
        worked fine. Tweeezers of this type are specified in the Suppliers
        section.

# Clean Up Parts

## Bill of Materials

{{BOM}}

The parts should almost be ready to assemble. However, there is often some overflow plastic in the holes, nut traps, or counter-bore holes. Also, some holes may not be round and may be hard to press the screws through. These areas should be cleaned up before doing the assembly step.

## Extra Plastic in Counter-Bore

Below is an example of a counter bore hole with an extra plastic string in it. This extra plastic will keep the bolt from seating properly in the bottom of the hole and must be removed.

Most plastic strings are easy to remove with [Tweezers]{Qty:1, Cat:Tool}. The string in the picture above can be removed by grabbing it with the tweezers and twisting.

## Non-Round Hole

Sometimes plastic will ooze when it should not, and can string across open areas. 3D printers also approximate round holes as a series of lines around a perimeter, so the holes are more like very detailed polygons when viewed closely enough. Most of the time there is no issue with the roundness of a hole, but the one in the picture below is bad enough that it will not let a bolt pass through.

In this case, a drill bit slightly smaller than the hole can be used to clean the hole up. Be careful not to force a drill bit through the hole that is too large, or the tolerance of the hole may be ruined. It is best not to use a drill to spin the drill bit except in cases where the hole cannot be cleared by running the drill bit by hand.
